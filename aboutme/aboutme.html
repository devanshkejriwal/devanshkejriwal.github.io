        <p class="lead">
          I'm a 2nd year Computer Science and Finance major at the
          University Of Waterloo
          aspiring to be an entrepreneur
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5">
          I believe creativity is the most important thing in life and to make my creative thoughts reality,
          I chose to pursue computer science. I love the idea of building things to make people's lives easier
          and that's what I try to do with all my projects.
          <br>
          Reading about different entrepreneurs and their journey inspires me and motivates me to
          learn new things that would make me a better and smarter person. I'm also a sports enthusiast and love
          playing all kinds of sports. Meeting new people is one of my favourite hobbies because it's just amazing
          how much a person can teach you.
